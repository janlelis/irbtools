Improvements for Ruby's IRB console, like colored output and a lot of
debugging and introspection methods. Unlike with PRY, you are still in your
normal IRB. It is designed to work out-of-the-box, so there is no reason to not
use it!

## Setup

    $ gem install irbtools

IRB executes code in `~/.irbrc` on start-up. If the file does not exist, yet,
just create a new one. Add the following content:

    require 'irbtools'

You also need to add irbtools to your project's Gemfile:

    gem 'irbtools', require: 'irbtools/binding'

Then start IRB (with **Irbtools** loaded) from the console or directly from your code with:

    binding.irb

If the `binding_of_caller` gem is available (e.g. see below), you can omit the `binding`:

    irb

### More Improvements

Some suggested gems will not be installed to ensure wider general support. For
the full feature set, you can add **irbtools-more** and change your
`.irbrc` to:

    require 'irbtools/more'

and edit your Gemfile to

    gem 'irbtools-more', require: 'irbtools/binding'

`cd` | path = nil | Changes the directory. Can also be used in these forms: `~cd` (change to home directory), `-cd` (change to previous directory).
`clear` | | Clear the terminal.
`code` | object = self, method_name | Display the method source with syntax highlighting. Will also look up C methods if the **core_docs** gem (which is included in **irbtools-more**) is available.
`colorize` | string | Syntax highlight a Ruby string.
`copy` | string | Copy something to the clipboard.
`copy_input` | | Copy session history to the clipboard.

`ed` / `emacs` / `mate` / `mvim` / `nano` / `vi` / `vim` | filename = nil | Start an editor in the session context.
`RubyEngine` | | Show the Ruby engine.
`howtocall` | object = self, method_or_proc | Displays parameter names and types for a proc or method.
`RubyInfo` | | List general information about the Ruby environment.
`ld` | file | Shortcut for `load lib.to_s + '.rb'`.
`ls` | path = "." | List directory content.
`mf` | object1, object2 | Find methods that turn one value into another value.
`mof` | object, depth = 0, grep = // | Print a method list, ordered by modules.

`pa` | string, color | Print a string in the specified color.
`page` | what, options = {} | Page long content.
`paste` | | Paste clipboard content.

`ray` | path | Syntax highlight a Ruby file.
`re` | string, regexg, groups = nil | Assists you when matching regexes againts strings.
`reset!` | | Restart the current IRB session.

`rr` | lib | Shortcut for `require_relative lib.to_s`.
`rrq` / `rerequire` | lib | Hack to remove a library from `$LOADED_FEATURES` and `require` it again.
`session_history` | number_of_lines = nil | Return a string of all commands issued in the current session.

`Object#ri` | *args | Show ri documentation for this object or method.


### Advanced tweaking

See [CONFIGURE.md](https://github.com/janlelis/irbtools/blob/master/CONFIGURE.md).


### Troubleshooting: ANSI colors on Windows

Windows: ANSI support can be enabled via
[ansicon](https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon) or
[ConEmu](http://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/).


### Troubleshooting: Clipboard not working on Linux

Clipboard support requires **xclip** or **xsel**. On ubuntu, do: `sudo apt-get
install xclip`


### Troubleshooting: Unicode causes wrong display widths

If you use double-width unicode characters, you will need to paste the
following snippet to your `~/.irbrc` file.

```ruby
Irbtools.replace_library_callback :fancy_irb do
  FancyIrb.start east_asian_width: true
end
```

This setting is deactivated by default, because of performance issues.


### Hint: Debundle

If you do not want to add **Irbtools** to your project's Gemfile, you will need a
[debundle hack](https://github.com/janlelis/debundle.rb). Put it at the
beginning of your `~/.irbrc` file and you are fine (until it breaks).


### Hint: No ANSI / IRB extension

You can use Irbtools without colors/irb extensions. To do so, put this into `~/.irbrc`:

```ruby
require 'irbtools/non_fancy'
Irbtools.start
```


### Hint: Web Console

**Irbtools** works well together with the amazing
[web-console!](https://github.com/rails/web-console)
