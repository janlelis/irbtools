= irbtools
The irbtools gem is a meta gem that installs handy and useful irb gems and provides an appealing ready-to-use irb configuration. It has a modular structure and supports multiple library-loading mechanisms, e.g. via <tt>autoload</tt> or threads.

== Setup
  gem install irbtools
  
* On Linux, you need +xclip+ or +xsel+ to use the clipboard: sudo <tt>apt-get install xclip</tt>
* On Windows, you need ansicon[https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon] to enjoy all the colors
* On MacOS, you need growl, to use the +g+ gem.

=== Wrong display widths?
When using double-width unicode chars, you need to paste the following snippet to your <tt>.irbrc</tt>.

  Irbtools.replace_library_callback :fancy_irb do
    FancyIrb.start :east_asian_width => true
  end

This setting is deactivated by default because of performance issues.

== Usage
To use irbtools, put the following in your <tt>~/.irbrc</tt> file (this file is loaded every time you start irb):

  require 'rubygems' unless defined? Gem # rubygems is only needed in 1.8
  require 'irbtools'

If the file does not exist, just create a new one.

It's possible to modify, which libraries should get loaded:

  # don't require 'irbtools', but:
  require 'irbtools/configure'
  # here you can modify the libraries using the methods below
  Irbtools.start

If you don't want to load the default set of irbtools gems, you will have to use <tt>require 'irbtools/minimal'</tt> instead of <tt>configure</tt>. You need to use the below methods for adding libraries in this case or *Irbtools* won't modify anything of your irb ;).

=== Rails notes
To use irbtools within the rails console, you will have to add <tt>irbtools</tt> to your Gemfile <b>in this way:</b> (or there will be some bundler double require issues..)

  gem 'irbtools', :require => 'irbtools/configure'

You can put Rails specific configuration in a <tt>~/.railsrc</tt> file that gets only loaded in Rails environments.

See {this blog post}[http://rbjl.net/49-railsrc-rails-console-snippets] for some Rails goodies. Please open an issue/say +1 in the comments there to get that stuff packaged into a gem.

=== Irbtools methods

The following general helper methods are defined by <b>every_day_irb</b> (which belongs to *irbtools*)

[ls]     Returns an array with the directory's content
[cat]    Shortcut for <tt>File.read</tt>

[session_history] Returns all issued commands as string
[dbg]    Shortcut for <tt>debugger</tt> that also requires 'ruby-debug' if needed

Irbtools also defines some more helpers in combination with the loaded gems:

[src]    Shortcut for displaying the method source using *method_source* and *coderay*
[l/ll]   Alternative method name to trigger the *looksee* gem


=== How to load more or less libraries
You have the following methods:
* <tt>Irbtools.add_library(lib, options_hash, &block)</tt>
* <tt>Irbtools.remove_library(lib)</tt>

The <tt>options_hash</tt> defines the way in which Irbtools loads the library. Following options are possible
[(no options)/<tt>:start</tt>] The library is required on startup before doing anything else (before displaying the prompt)
[<tt>:thread => identifier</tt>] After loading everything else, the library is required in a thread (while continuing loading). You can choose any identifier, but if you take the same one for multiple libraries, they will be loaded in the same thread (in the order that you define)
[<tt>:late => true</tt>] The library is required just before showing the prompt (note: loading threads might still be in process)
[<tt>:late_thread => identifier</tt>] Same as <tt>:thread</tt>, but after loading late libraries.
[<tt>:sub_session => true</tt>] The library is loaded every time a sub-session starts (using <tt>IRB.conf[:IRB_RC]</tt>). In ripl[https://github.com/cldwalker/ripl], <tt>ripl-after_rc</tt> is used.
[<tt>:autoload => :Constant</tt>] Use Ruby's <tt>autoload</tt> feature. It loads the library as soon as the constant is encountered.

You can also apply a block that gets executed after the library is loaded (except for autoload, the code will executed on startup in this case). You can also just add callback block by using the <tt>Irbtools.add_library_callback</tt> or the <tt>Irbtools.replace_library_callback</tt> method.

When adding a new library, you should firstly consider some way to load it via <tt>:autoload</tt>.
If not possible, try loading via thread.
If that is not possible either, fallback to the default loading.

== Hint: Faster start-up

You can get an about a second faster start-up time by changing the loading methods for wirb and fancy_irb to <tt>:thread</tt> (drawback: the hash rocket will not be used for the first result):

  require 'irbtools/configure'
  Irbtools.remove_library :paint
  Irbtools.remove_library :fancy_irb
  Irbtools.add_library :paint, :late => true do Wirb.load_schema :classic_paint if defined? Wirb end
  Irbtools.add_library :fancy_irb, :thread => -1 do FancyIrb.start end
  Irbtools.start

== Welcome message
The welcome message can be customized with <tt>Irbtools.welcome_message=</tt>

== Packages
There are irbtools extension packages, which can be modified via:
* <tt>Irbtools.add_package(pkg)</tt>
* <tt>Irbtools.remove_package(pkg)</tt>

These packages add/modify the libraries to be loaded. For an example, see {irbtools-more}[https://github.com/janlelis/irbtools-more].
